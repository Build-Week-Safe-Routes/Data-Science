## Project Description   

**PROJECT NAME**   
Safe Routes  

**DESCRIPTION**   
Pitch:  
What are the most dangerous intersections in the city|state|country   

MVP:   
1. Address / Intersection input field   
2. Interactive Map showing crash statistic for a given intersection  
3. Show historical crashes on the map for given time period  
4. Create a model that predicts the chances of a car accident at a given intersection  
5. Visualization should indicate the likelyhood of crashes at different locations  
6. MVP should have a limited geographic scope   

Stretch:   
1. Ask user to use their location, if available.   
2. Expand geographic scope of the map  
3. Create a model that predicts where the next accident is most likely to occur."
